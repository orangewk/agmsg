# On codex 0.141+ the SessionStart hook cannot resolve the thread id
# (CODEX_THREAD_ID is not exported and no rollout is written for --remote
# sessions), so the bridge discovers the live TUI thread itself via
# thread/loaded/list (`--thread loaded`). If an older codex DID write a request
# file with a real thread id, that id is used instead. See #170, #41.
